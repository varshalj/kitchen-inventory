# Voice agent — implementation learnings

Captured 2026-06-01 after Slices 0 & 1 shipped end-to-end. The
README.md covers the *what* (current setup, known import paths, model
identifiers). This document captures the *what would have made us
faster* — the iteration patterns and discovery sequences that ate
time, so the next slice doesn't repeat them.

Read this before starting a new voice-agent slice. Read the README
when you're already in the code.

## The meta-lesson: voice has three independent API drift surfaces

Slices 0–1 burned roughly 8–10 deploy cycles on API drift. The drift came from three independent surfaces, and the pattern of "deploy → see error → patch import → redeploy" is the dominant cost.

The three surfaces that drift:

1. **Pipecat Python server-side** — package layout, class names, removed/renamed types
2. **Pipecat JS client-side** — package names on npm, exports, CDN transpilation
3. **Provider APIs** — Sarvam model identifiers, OpenAI realtime vs chat completions

**Predictive rule:** before writing the first import, allocate ~30 min for `/diagnostics`-style introspection. It's cheaper to learn what's there than to guess and redeploy.

---

## Faster-start playbook for the next slice

Apply these *before* writing new pipeline code:

### 1. Re-run `/diagnostics` immediately after Pipecat version bumps

The endpoint at [pipeline.py — diagnostics](pipeline.py) probes import paths and lists module exports for the Pipecat version currently deployed. **Hit it once at the start of any session that touches Pipecat code.** Saves at least one deploy cycle of "I guessed; deploy errored on import; patch import path; redeploy."

When extending to new Pipecat surfaces (function calling, audio mixers, observers, etc.), add probe targets to the `/diagnostics` candidates list *before* writing the pipeline code that uses them.

### 1b. For "what frame is emitted at moment X?" — add a one-shot `first-saw` print

When you need to hook into a specific lifecycle event (assistant turn complete, user stopped speaking, tool result ready, etc.), Pipecat's frame names are the API surface. They drift between versions, aren't always documented, and guessing wastes deploys.

The diagnostic that worked (Slice 1 Stage 3): add a `FrameProcessor` whose only job is to print each unique frame type name once per session.

```python
class FrameNameProbe(FrameProcessor):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self._seen = set()
    async def process_frame(self, frame, direction):
        await super().process_frame(frame, direction)
        name = type(frame).__name__
        if name not in self._seen:
            self._seen.add(name)
            print(f"frame-probe: first-saw {name}", flush=True)
        await self.push_frame(frame, direction)
```

Drop it anywhere in the pipeline, run a session, `modal app logs ... | grep frame-probe`, then patch your real logic with the correct names. This is what surfaced `LLMContextAssistantTimestampFrame` in ~one deploy cycle vs. multiple guess-and-check rounds.

### 2. Check Pipecat's CHANGELOG before each new feature

[github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md)

Pipecat is moving fast. In one quarter we hit three removed/renamed APIs:
- `pipecat.transports.network.fastapi_websocket` → `pipecat.transports.websocket.fastapi`
- `OpenAILLMContext` (removed) → universal `LLMContext`
- `RTVIConfig` (removed) → `RTVIProcessor()` takes no config

WebSearch / WebFetch on `docs.pipecat.ai` for the specific class is faster than guessing and waiting for Modal logs.

### 3. Don't trust the doc examples blindly

Pipecat's official docs lag the codebase. We hit this with `OpenAILLMContext` — current docs still reference it; GitHub examples use `LLMContext`. **When docs and CHANGELOG disagree, trust the CHANGELOG / examples.**

### 4. JS client SDKs are renamed more often than Python ones

`@pipecat-ai/client-web` → `@pipecat-ai/client-js`. Before importing, hit `https://www.npmjs.com/~pipecat-ai` and confirm package names exist *now*.

### 5. Use jsdelivr's `+esm`, not esm.sh, for Pipecat JS

esm.sh mistranspiles Pipecat's class inheritance — gives
`Class constructor E cannot be invoked without 'new'` deep inside transport code. jsdelivr's `+esm` bundler handles it.

```html
<!-- BAD: https://esm.sh/@pipecat-ai/websocket-transport -->
<!-- GOOD: -->
<script type="module">
  import * as PipecatWS from "https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@pipecat-ai/websocket-transport@1.6.5/+esm";
</script>
```

## Specific iteration sequences that cost us deploys

Numbered roughly by impact. For each, the root cause is captured plus
the diagnostic that would have surfaced it in one shot.

### Pipecat 1.3.0 transport reorg (Slice 0)

**Symptom:** `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'pipecat.transports.network'`
**Root cause:** transports moved to `pipecat.transports.websocket.fastapi` in 1.3.x
**Fast diagnostic:** `/diagnostics` import_probes section already lists current locations.
**Apply this lesson by:** treating *every* `pipecat.*` import as drift-prone on a new install. Run `/diagnostics` before deploying real pipeline code.

### Sarvam model name drift (Slice 0)

**Symptom:** Sarvam returns `Unsupported model 'saarika:v2'. Allowed values: saaras:v2.5, saaras:v3, saarika:v2.5.`
**Root cause:** Sarvam deprecated `saarika:v2`; we caught that. Then Slice 1 we missed that `saarika:v2.5` is itself now legacy — the current SOTA is `saaras:v3` with `mode="transcribe"`.
**Fast diagnostic:** check [docs.sarvam.ai](https://docs.sarvam.ai/api-reference-docs/models/saarika) or [Saaras V3 announcement](https://www.sarvam.ai/blogs/asr) *before* picking a model. Sarvam's error messages are excellent — they tell you the allowed list — but only after a failed deploy.
**Apply this lesson by:** treating Sarvam model identifiers as *checked-against-docs each time you bump or start a new project*. Don't assume yesterday's working identifier is today's recommended.

### RTVI protocol mismatch (Slice 0)

**Symptom:** WebSocket connects, mic captures, audio flows server-side, but Sarvam STT never emits a transcription. Modal logs show pipeline started, Sarvam connected, then nothing.
**Root cause:** `@pipecat-ai/websocket-transport` (the JS client SDK we use) speaks the **RTVI protocol**. `pipecat.transports.websocket.fastapi.FastAPIWebsocketTransport` (server) speaks **raw Pipecat frames**. They handshake fine over WebSocket but talk different application-layer protocols — frames are silently dropped.
**Fix:** wrap the server pipeline with `RTVIProcessor` (in the pipeline) + `RTVIObserver` (on the `PipelineTask`).
**Apply this lesson by:** whenever pairing a Pipecat JS client SDK with a server transport, **assume RTVI on the client and confirm RTVI on the server.** If using FastAPIWebsocketTransport, you must add the RTVI bridge.

### Echo emitting `TextFrame` instead of `TTSSpeakFrame` (Slice 0)

**Symptom:** STT transcribes, but TTS doesn't speak the echo back.
**Root cause:** Pipecat TTS services don't synthesize raw `TextFrame`; they expect `TTSSpeakFrame` (direct command) or text wrapped in LLM aggregation markers (`LLMResponseStartFrame` → `LLMTextFrame` → `LLMResponseEndFrame`).
**Apply this lesson by:** when emitting text *outside* an LLM service (e.g. from a passthrough processor or a programmatic greeting), wrap in `TTSSpeakFrame`. When emitting *from* an LLM service, the aggregation markers are added automatically by `OpenAILLMService`.

### OpenAILLMContext removed (Slice 1 Stage 1)

**Symptom:** `ModuleNotFoundError: pipecat.processors.aggregators.openai_llm_context`
**Root cause:** Removed in favor of provider-agnostic `LLMContext` + `LLMContextAggregatorPair`.
**Fast diagnostic:** [Pipecat CHANGELOG](https://github.com/pipecat-ai/pipecat/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) — this was a documented migration.
**Apply this lesson by:** when wiring an LLM service, use `LLMContext(messages, tools=...)` and `LLMContextAggregatorPair(context)`. Forget about `OpenAILLMContext`.

### Supabase auth-cookie location surprises (Slice 1 Stage 2)

**Symptom:** Spent ~30 min trying to find the user's Supabase access_token in browser storage. Looked in localStorage on wrong origin (`vercel.live` instead of the app), found custom-named keys, discovered Supabase splits the session across multiple cookies with `@supabase/ssr`.
**Root cause:** Multiple plausible storage locations:
- localStorage on the app's origin (if not using `@supabase/ssr`)
- A cookie like `sb-<ref>-auth-token` — but split across `.0`, `.1` shards
- Sometimes also in sessionStorage
- Vercel preview deployments add a separate `vercel.live` iframe with its own storage that's *not* relevant
**Fix:** added a `/api/dev/voice-token` server route that calls `supabase.auth.getSession()` and returns the access_token cleanly. **Should have been the first thing built when we decided on JWT-based auth.**
**Apply this lesson by:** whenever a flow needs a user JWT for testing, build the server endpoint that returns it *before* you start the testing loop. Five minutes upfront saves multiple debugging sessions.

### AgentTurnLogger missed assistant turns due to wrong frame-name check (Slice 1 Stage 3)

**Symptom:** User transcripts logged correctly; agent (LLM-generated) responses didn't appear in `voice_session_logs`. Only the direct-TTS greeting (logged outside the pipeline) showed up as an `agent` row.
**Root cause:** Hardcoded a list of plausible "assistant turn complete" frame names (`LLMResponseEndFrame`, `LLMFullResponseEndFrame`, etc.) — none of which matched Pipecat 1.3.0's actual emission, which is `LLMContextAssistantTimestampFrame`.
**Fast diagnostic:** the "print every unique frame type once per session" pattern (see Playbook §1b) surfaced the right name in one deploy cycle.
**Apply this lesson by:** when hooking into Pipecat lifecycle events, *probe before guessing*. Three-minute helper class > three deploy cycles of guesses.

### UserTurnLogger positioned downstream of aggregator (Slice 1 Stage 3)

**Symptom:** `voice_session_logs` had `system` and `agent` rows but no `user` rows.
**Root cause:** Placed `UserTurnLogger` *after* `context_aggregator.user()` in the pipeline. The aggregator consumes `TranscriptionFrame` and emits a different (context) frame downstream — so the logger never saw the raw transcript.
**Fix:** move `UserTurnLogger` to the position immediately after `stt`, *before* the user aggregator.
**Apply this lesson by:** any FrameProcessor that wants to observe a specific input frame type must sit upstream of any processor that consumes that type. Pipecat aggregators are transformers, not pass-throughs.

### Supabase moved to asymmetric JWT signing (Slice 1 Stage 2)

**Symptom:** `Token failed verification: The specified alg value is not allowed`
**Root cause:** Supabase migrated newer projects from HS256 (shared `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`) to RS256/ES256 (per-project key pair, verified via JWKS endpoint). Our code only allowed HS256.
**Fix:** detect `alg` from JWT header, route to:
- HS256 → verify with `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET`
- RS256/ES256 → fetch JWKS from `{SUPABASE_URL}/auth/v1/.well-known/jwks.json`, verify with public key
- Add `PyJWT[crypto]` extra for cryptography support
**Apply this lesson by:** never assume Supabase auth is HS256. Always inspect the header and route accordingly. Use `pyjwt.get_unverified_header(token)["alg"]` and branch.

### WebSocket close-before-accept produces generic 1006 (Slice 1 Stage 2)

**Symptom:** Browser sees `1006 abnormal closure` no matter what server-side code says.
**Root cause:** Calling `websocket.close(code=4001)` before `websocket.accept()` doesn't send the close code to the browser — the browser just sees a generic disconnect.
**Fix:** always `accept()` first, then `send_json({error: ...})` for diagnostics, then `close(code=4001, reason=...)`. Browser receives both the error JSON and the proper close code.
**Apply this lesson by:** any WebSocket auth gate that wants its close codes visible should accept first, validate second.

## Workflow patterns that worked

These are the things that *did* save time. Reapply them.

### Diagnostic endpoints on the deployed service

`/health` (sanity check) and `/diagnostics` (introspect Pipecat module layout) were disproportionately valuable. **Build these in the first 30 minutes of any new Pipecat service.** They turn deploy-and-pray into deploy-and-inspect.

### Catalog-first development

Already documented in [decisions.md ADR 005 postscript](../docs/decisions.md) — writing the feature catalog YAML *before* the consuming code surfaced naming and scope decisions upfront. Zero rework when Stage 2 wired tools — catalog already specified them correctly.

### One-deploy-per-decision iteration

Each deploy cycle answers one specific question. Don't bundle changes — if you change four things and a deploy fails, you can't isolate. The pace felt slow but the alternative (compound changes + bisecting failures) was slower.

### Modal logs in a second terminal

`modal app logs <app-name>` running in a separate terminal during browser testing surfaces server-side errors in real time. Without this, you'd have to disconnect, query, reconnect, repeat. Always run it.

### Commit at every working milestone

We have separate commits for Slice 0 scaffold, Slice 0 WIP, Slice 0 working, Slice 1 Stage 1, etc. When something breaks unexpectedly, `git diff` against the last working commit narrows the search space dramatically.

## Open questions / things to investigate when next picking this up

- **Does Pipecat 1.3.0+ support `PyJWKClient` caching the way I assumed?** Each WebSocket connect currently fetches JWKS unless PyJWKClient's default cache kicks in. Worth a smoke test on cold-start latency.
- **Sarvam Saaras v3 mode="transcribe" vs default behavior** — we set mode explicitly, but if default is also transcribe for saaras:v3 we could simplify. Verify against current Sarvam docs.
- **Pipecat function-calling API stability** — we verified `register_function()` + `FunctionSchema` + `ToolsSchema` work in 1.3.0. These are highly likely to drift; pin or re-verify on each Pipecat bump.

---

## Quick-reference: who-renamed-what cheat sheet

If something stops working after a Pipecat / Pipecat-client / Sarvam version bump, check these first:

| Component | Old name (deprecated) | Current name (2026-06) |
|---|---|---|
| Pipecat FastAPI transport | `pipecat.transports.network.fastapi_websocket` | `pipecat.transports.websocket.fastapi` |
| Pipecat OpenAI context | `OpenAILLMContext` from `…openai_llm_context` | `LLMContext` from `…llm_context` |
| Pipecat OpenAI context aggregator | `llm.create_context_aggregator(ctx)` | `LLMContextAggregatorPair(ctx)` |
| Pipecat RTVI config | `RTVIConfig` (removed) | `RTVIProcessor()` no-arg |
| Pipecat "assistant turn complete" frame | unknown / had to discover | `LLMContextAssistantTimestampFrame` |
| Pipecat "user stopped speaking" frame | — | `UserStoppedSpeakingFrame` (VAD-emitted) |
| Pipecat JS client npm package | `@pipecat-ai/client-web` | `@pipecat-ai/client-js` |
| Sarvam STT model | `saarika:v2`, `saarika:v2.5` (legacy) | `saaras:v3` + `mode="transcribe"` |
| Sarvam TTS model | `bulbul:v2` (deprecated but still works) | `bulbul:v3` voice `"shubh"` |
| Supabase JWT algorithm | HS256 with `SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET` | Mixed — RS256/ES256 via JWKS on newer projects |

Update this table whenever a future Pipecat/Sarvam version bump renames something.
